# array-multiplier

An Array Multiplier is a digital circuit used for fast multiplication of binary numbers. It is based on the repeated addition method, similar to how multiplication is performed manually.

ðŸ“Œ Advantages of Array Multiplier in Digital Systems

Simple Structure â€“ Easy to implement using AND gates and adders.

Parallel Processing â€“ All partial products are generated simultaneously.

Fast Multiplication â€“ Faster than shift-and-add multiplication.

Scalability â€“ Can be extended to higher bit-width multipliers.

Optimized for Hardware â€“ Useful in FPGA and ASIC implementations.
